Databench
=========


Here we present benchmark datasets of topic of high scientific interest for agrogeophysicists:

Data-driven Cole-Cole parameters for root-soil-plant interactions experiments
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Survey metatdata:
- soil type
- field/lab
- raw soil/vegetated soil
- saturated/unsaturated
- type of fitting model


Pedophysical relationships
--------------------------

Survey metatdata:
- soil type
- field/lab
- raw soil/vegetated soil
- saturated/unsaturated
- type of fitting model

Data format: 
- 1st collumn: ECb in S/m
- 2nd collumn: SWC in cm3/cm-3 


Codebench
=========

Here we present a simple model dataset created after a RWU simulation:

Time lapse inversion of RWU
---------------------------

test of different inversion codes and approaches to describe the time-lapse evolution of ER/soil water content.
